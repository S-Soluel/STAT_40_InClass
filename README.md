# STAT 40 In-Class Examples and Practice (4/21/2021)
This R script shows when I created a fairly simple function to compute the scale of values within a vector, and then return that scale to the user. Additionally, this was built upon to create a separate function that allowed this to instead apply to matrices, which would then have the relative scale of their values returned in the form of another matrix.
- Further comments are noted within the R file.
